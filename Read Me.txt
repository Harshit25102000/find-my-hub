This web app takes a location and returns locations plotted on map along with lat and long and address which are suitable for the user to live 
While creating account this app will ask some questions to classify user using KNN and then generate 100 points around the location , find details 
about each point that is number of gyms , coffee , restaurants etc. and classify these locations and user will see only those locations which are
perfect for him. For user classification , data used was downloaded from kaggle and clustered using Kmeans and for amenitites , dataset was made by
